The contact form doesn't work.  This was more of a trial to see if I could take a bootstrap template and convert it into express app.  This is something I did when learning flask as a first solo project so I mostly just converted it to expressjs.  I built the JSON data I use on npoint.io  

None of the css styles used were created by me.

requirements for the project are express ^4.18.1 / axios ^0.27.2 / and ejs ^3.1.8 and can be found in the package.json file.  Nodemon is used as a dev dependency for ease of development.
